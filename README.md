# Help-Me - Request help from tutors

Help-Me enables students to request help from their assigned tutors.
To request the help the user creates a request where a message can be left.
This message should contain a link where the student can be reached (e.g. a Zoom link).
The tutors can see all request and process them until all requests are done.

This project was done as part of the Rust course at the
[HSA](https://www.hs-augsburg.de/Informatik.html) and therefore uses Rust
for the front- and backend of the service.
